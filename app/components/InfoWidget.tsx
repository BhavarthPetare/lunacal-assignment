Both of them are just starting school, so my calender is usually blocked between 9-10 AM. This is a really exciting new chapter for our family, and I appreciate your flexibility with my morning schedule. Once the school run is done and I\'ve had my coffee, my focus is entirely on helping my clients succeed. I specialize in leveraging the Salesforce platform to streamline operations and drive real growth. I\'m passionate about finding the right solution for your unique challenges. Please feel free to book a time on my calendar, and I look forward to connecting!',

			'Before joining the Salesforce family, I cut my teeth in the fast-paced world of tech startups. That experience taught me the importance of agility and finding creative solutions to tough problems. Here at Salesforce, I\'ve channeled that energy into helping my clients, primarily in the retail and consumer goods sectors, navigate their digital transformations. One of my proudest moments was helping a local brand streamline their customer service process, which led to a 30% increase in customer satisfaction scores. For me, it\'s not just about selling software; it\'s about understanding your vision and building a long-term foundation for your success.',

		btext:
			'The key takeaway for me was the concept of \'tactical empathy\'â€”understanding the perspective of the person on the other side of the table to build trust and uncover what they truly need. It\'s not about winning a battle; it\'s about collaboratively solving a puzzle. The principles in this book have been invaluable in my conversations, helping me move beyond surface-level discussions to build stronger, more transparent partnerships with my clients. It\'s a must-read for anyone who wants to communicate more effectively.',
